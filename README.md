# BIO539_Exam4

Assignment: "Write a python script that, when run using the command line, outputs the linguistic complexity of
each sequence in a file of sequences. For the sake of simplicity let's assume that we use only 4
possible characters (A, C, G, T), so the number of possible k-mers is 4^k. The file should be specified
by the end user as a command line argument."

This repository contains four files:
1. README with instructions on what the code does and how to run it.
2. Python script (Exam4_Code.py)
3. Python test script (test_Exam4.py)
4. Example data file with a couple of short strings (Exam4_ExampleData.txt)
